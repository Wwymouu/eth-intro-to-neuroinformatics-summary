\section{Synapse}
\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item First mentioned by Sherrington (1873).
	\item Otto Loewi experimented with the vagus nerve.
	\subitem Stimulating the vagus nerve slows down the heart beat, has an inhibitory function.
	\subitem Ringers solution is a mixture of chemicals in which the heart can continue beating.
	\subitem When switching the solution with one that has been used with an activated vagus nerve, the heart will slow down.
	\item It was found that the ``Vagusstoff'' is acetylcholine (ACh).
	\item The synapses are receptive for nicotine, muscarine and acetylcholine, because of ACh-receptors. This makes certain substances very addictive.
	\item Residual acetylcholine has to be cleared and removed immediately. This happens with acetylcholine esterase enzymes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Synapse properties}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Only vesicles which are already on the presynaptic membrane (docked) will be released after the AP, not all of them.
	\item One single synapse produces only a small potential. More are needed for an actual action potential.
	\item Release of neurotransmitters is calcium dependent.
	\item Probabilistic release of neurotransmitter.
	\subitem In the CNS, most of the time only one vesicle is released with probability $0.2$ to $0.4$.
	\subitem An amplitude histogram shows poisson distribution, which gives the probability of firing.
	\subitem The action potential (probability of firing of synapses, probability of postsynaptic receptors to bind neurotransmitter) give the plasticity (overall probability of passing action potential to postsynaptic neuritic changes).
	\item Single activated synapse is usually not enough. EPSP is about $0.1\,mV$.
	\item The current-voltage lines have bio-measured sigmoid-curves, because channels open with a probability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Synaptic mechanism}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Synthesis: Building blocks of transmitter substance gets to the terminal where neurotransmitter is synthesized and packed into vesicles.
	\item Release: In response to an AP, the transmitter is released, across the membrane, by exocytosis. The presynapse has voltage-gated $Ca^{2+}$ channels, which will cause an inflow and trigger vesicle fusion (exocytosis).
	\item Receptor activation: The transmitter crosses the synaptic cleft and binds to a receptor.
	\item Inactivation: The transmitter is taken back or inactivated in the synaptic cleft.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Receptor types}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Ionotropic receptor} & \textbf{Metabotropic receptor}\\\hline
	Binding site + channel combined & Binding site not associated with channel\\\hline
	Second messenger independent & G-protein or second messenger involved\\\hline
	Short latency action & Longer latency\\\hline
	Rapid response (10 to 50 ms) & Slow responses\\\hline
	Postsynaptic, in general & Pre- and postsynaptic\\\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Synapse types}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Electrical synapse} & \textbf{Chemical synapse}\\\hline
	Simple primitive system & Highly developed structure\\\hline
	Often symmetrical, bidirectional & Polarized, structurally and functionally\\\hline
	Gap junction (connexins) & Pre: active zone, post: postsynaptic density\\\hline
	Very fast, no synaptic delay & Slower, synaptic delay (0.5 ms)\\\hline
	$Ca^{2+}$-independent & Transmitter release requires $Ca^{2+}$ influx\\\hline
	Large synapse & Thousands of small synapses\\\hline
	Limited functions, usually excitatory & Versatile: Excitatory and inhibitory\\\hline
	Synchronized activity & Specific: point to point communication\\\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Receptor overview}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}

	\textbf{Receptor} & \textbf{Transmitter} & \textbf{Ions} & \textbf{Approx. $E_{rev}$} & \textbf{Agonist}\\\hline
	AMPA & glutamate & Na, K, Ca & $+0\,mV$ & AMPA\\\hline
	NMDA & glutamate & Na, K, Ca & $+0\,mV$ & NDMA\\\hline
	mGLU & glutamate & G-coupled & & \\\hline
	$GABA_A$ & gaba & Cl & $-65\,mV$ & muscimol\\\hline
	$GABA_B$ & gaba & K & $-90\,mV$ & \\\hline

\subsection{Glutamate receptors}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Glutamate enables both synapses, but NMDA is voltage dependent, while AMPA is not.
	\item The receptors end up being conductive for $Na^+$ and $K^+$, as well as $Ca^{2+}$. 10 times more for $Ca^{2+}$ than the others.
	\item $E_S = 0\,mV$
	\item $Ca^{2+}$ inflow causes a calcium cascade: Phosphorylation ($PO_4$) of the channel proteines opens channels even more.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{NMDA}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Voltage dependent.
	\item The channel is blocked by $Mg^+$ below voltages of $-40\,mV$.
	\item The block gets pushed out with more positive voltage.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{AMPA}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Voltage independent.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GABA}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item GABA-A is for $Cl^-$, ionotropic (fast), $-65\,mV$
	\item GABA-B is for $K^+$, metabotropic (slow), $-90\,mV$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Neuromodulators}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Neurotransmitter that is not reabsorbed by the pre-synaptic neuron or broken down into a metabolite.
	\item These end up a longer time in the cerebrospinal fluid, modulating the activity of several other neurons in the brain.
	\item For example norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonine.
\end{itemize}
